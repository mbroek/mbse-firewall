# External interface that will be protected as internet connection.

# External IPv6 tunnel interface that will be protected as internet connection.
# Enable this if you use a tunnel broker for IPv6.
#IF_EXT6="six0"

# If the external gateway is a border gateway, (your internet connection) then
# set the next option. Certain protocols are disabled in this case, and some
# are just enabled.
#IF_EXT_IS_BORDER_GW="1"

# Enable automatic blacklisting of hosts that do any kind portscanning.
# This is tested by any rules not matched on the external interface(s) INPUT
# or FORWARD chain and is a repeated undefined port from the same IP.
# These hosts are blocked using ipset for one hour.
#IF_EXT_AUTO_BLOCK="1"

# Use global blocking table. This just inserts rules to block hosts that
# are found in the sets global-blk4 or global-blk6. Other programs like
# ossec, fail2ban etc need to put the bad hosts in these tables.
#IF_EXT_GLOBAL_BLOCK="1"

# Block time in seconds when a host is blocked. Default is 3600.

# If you have a bridged interface like br0 with physical interfaces eth0 and

# these interfaces. You can turn this off by setting the next variable.
